# PebbleFace

This is an educational tutorial I followed to get myself started with Pebble development for projects to come.
There is a lot of commenting as I went along, and I logged down what I learnt from compilation errors, such as scope of local variables and order of function declarations. I have also put alternative thoughts in some comment blocks for future reference on how to do things better.

The end product is a Pebble watchface with customized font and bitmap background, there is also an additional text layer which periodically pulls current temperature and weather condition from an outside API, by providing the user's current location.
